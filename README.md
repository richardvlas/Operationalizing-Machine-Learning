# Operationalizing-Machine-Learning

In this project we use Microsoft Azure Cloud Computing Services to configure a cloud-based machine learning production model, deploy it, and consume it. We will also create, publish, and consume a pipeline. 

The dataset used to train the ML model consists of Bank Marketing data and can be found [here](https://automlsamplenotebookdata.blob.core.windows.net/automl-sample-notebook-data/bankmarketing_train.csv).
